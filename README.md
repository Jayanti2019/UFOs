# UFOs
## Purpose 
Dana's webpage has dynamic tables to show the information, but with this project we will provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Additional filters for the city, state, country, and shape are added to the existing date filter.

## Results
Original web page has only one filter Date. Users able to search for only date of sighting. 
We added four filters that users can search by. New filters are City, State, Country, and Shape. Following are all the filters.

These filters help users with finding sightings specific to a state. Ca for Example. Highlighted value shows the filter chosen as ca and results for sightings in california

## Summary
### Drawback of the page
  - Data is limited to few days
  - Data is also limited to only us
### Recommendations for further development
  - To do a better analysis of the UFO sightings we need to present more data, including a bigger scope on date and more international
  - To give users a better experience on this page, we should probably have some kind of authenticity for these UFO sightings
